# Introduction
Hey im Akira and i wrote the Batch Scripts you can see above. These were my first ever made Batch Scripts.
They are aimed to improve the performance of a PC with tweaks i used myself at that point of time.
I wrote them for a PC support Twitter Account i had with someone back in time named, you guessed it, DirectFavor.


# Tweaks?
I mostly used regedit edits and some internet commands to make it ,,faster,,.
Welp i was young at that time (probably 13), while now beeing nearly 3 years older.
Some are mostly placebo i guess.

# Broken?
If your searchbar doesnt work anymore on any other thing, please use the Fix.reg or restore your backup.

Your Akira the VSCode Girl
